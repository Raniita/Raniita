### Hi there! 👋 I'm a frog aka 'Ranii' 🐸
- 🔧 I'm a MSc Telecom Engineer from Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena (UPCT), Spain
- ⚡ I’m also a Python backend developer (Flask/FastAPI way!)
- 🤖 Futhermore, I have my personal electronics labs, usually to repair random stuff. Some of the last things repaired: 
  * _Game & Watch: Zelda_ (CFW mod, retro-go, and liberate the console)
  * _ZX+ Spectrum 48k_ (keyboard membrane + lower RAM issue + power rails broken)
  * _Game Gear_ (switch caps + change to a LCD screen)
  * _Game Boy Color_ (absolutely broken power switch)
  * _Atari 2600 Jr_ (major cleaning + change joysticks connector + custom paddle controler)
- 🧰 Hobbyist Linux Servers, Homelab, Selfhosted, SysAdmin, DevOps, Cloud, SRE, etc...
- 🌱 Fun fact: Love mechanical keyboards, cooking & home gardening (chillies lover 🌶️)
